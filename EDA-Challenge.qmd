## Setup

tidyverse library for data import and wrangling.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Loading the dataset and inspecting variables

From the provided URL we can first load the data set into the object called "d".

```{r}
f<- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/difiore/ada-datasets/main/data-wrangling.csv"
d<- read_csv(f, col_names = TRUE)

```

We can take a quick lookat the data we loaded and variables in it.

```{r}
head(d)
dim(d)
str(d)

#Listing variable names

names(d)
```

## Step 1

#### Creating new variables

1.  **BSD** (body size dimorphism) - Ratio of average male to female body mass.

2.  **sex_ratio** - Ratio of the number of adult females to adult males in a typical group.

3.  **DI** (for “defensibility index”) - Ratio of day range length to the diameter of the home range.
